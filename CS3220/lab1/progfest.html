        <h1><strong>The Challenge</strong></h1>
    </header>
    <main>
<p><u>This year's ProgFest will be different from prior years.</u> It consists of data
    structure and algorithm
    exercises within Android applications. The first part of the day will be a 2 hour
    hands-on workshop
    on creating very basic Android applications. The rest of the day will involve
    creating Android games
    that require the use of relatively sophisticated algorithms and data structures.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>All exercises will be done in Java (with a small amount of XML) - a good grasp of
            Java is required.</li>
        <li>Knowledge of at least these Java data structures is needed: HashMaps, ArrayLists,
            Sets, Trees, Tries.</li>
        <li>Knowledge of recursion would be helpful, along with algorithms such as breadth-
            first search and depth-first
            search.</li>
        <li>Knowledge of basic text Java IO would also be helpful.</li>
        <li>Practice using Android Studio and deploying Android apps to an emulator will make
            doing the projects
            easier.</li>
    </ul>
